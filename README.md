Final Project
Will Hittson
notes*

I have absolutely no idea whats wrong with my VS setup, but no matter what it try I cant get the Scaffolding stuff to work on my pc, even when I open the completed lab 11 solution code, When I run the scaffolding stuff through my terminal absolutely nothing happens. I tried multiple things, different NET versions, different VS studio code versions, Idk. Anyways I feel like I got almost everything besides that done pretty good inside this project and had a ton of fun making something related to a game that i really like.
